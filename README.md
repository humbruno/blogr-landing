### What I learned

Making navbars is hard! This was by far the biggest project I've worked on so far, and while making a navbar is quite frustrating for someone with my level of experience, I definitely learned a lot. It was also great continuation practice to handling images and how to properly use absolute positioning.

My confidence in JavaScript is growing steadily and I look forward to doing more exciting things with it!
